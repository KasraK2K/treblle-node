Treblle makes it super easy to understand whatâ€™s going on with your APIs and the apps that use them. Just by adding Treblle to your API out of the box you get:

- Real-time API monitoring and logging
- Auto-generated API docs with OAS support
- API analytics
- Quality scoring
- One-click testing
- API managment on the go
- and more...

## Requirements

- nodejs

## Dependencies

- [`express`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [`node-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch)

## Installation

You can install Treblle for Node via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). Simply run the following command:

```bash
$ npm install treblle
```

Don't forget to load the required JS modules in your app.js like so:

```js
const express = require("express");
const { useTreblle } = require("treblle");
```

## Getting started

Next, create a FREE account on <https://treblle.com> to get an API key and Project ID. After you have those simply initialize Treblle in your **app.js** file like so for Express:

```js
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

useTreblle(app, {
  apiKey: "_YOUR_API_KEY_",
  projectId: "_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_",
});
```

That's it. Your API requests and responses are now being sent to your Treblle project. Just by adding that line of code you get features like: auto-documentation, real-time request/response monitoring, error tracking and so much more.

### Koa integration

If you're using koa, then you can enable Treblle like this:

```js
const Koa = require("koa");
const KoaRouter = require("koa-router");
const KoaBody = require("koa-body");
const { koaTreblle } = require("treblle");

const app = new Koa();
const router = new KoaRouter();

app.use(
  koaTreblle({
    apiKey: "_YOUR_API_KEY_",
    projectId: "_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_",
  })
);
```

### Strapi integration

Treblle has support for Strapi as well, to start using it you need to define the middleware first and then enable the middleware.

This guide is based on the strapi quickstart project, you can create it and follow by running the following command:

```sh
npx create-strapi-app my-project --quickstart
```

First define the middleware in `middlewares/treblle/index.js` like this:

```js
const { strapiTreblle } = require("treblle");

module.exports = (strapi) => {
  return {
    initialize() {
      strapi.app.use(
        strapiTreblle({
          apiKey: "_YOUR_API_KEY_",
          projectId: "_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_",
        })
      );
    },
  };
};
```

Then enable the Treblle middleware in `config/middleware.js` like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  load: {
    before: ["boom", "treblle"],
  },
  settings: {
    treblle: {
      enabled: true,
    },
  },
};
```

### Running Treblle only in production

If you want to run Treblle only in production, you can rely on the environment variables, or use a similar approach via config.

```js
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  useTreblle(app, {
    apiKey: "_YOUR_API_KEY_",
    projectId: "_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_",
  });
}
```

### Need to hide additional fields?

If you want to expand the list of fields you want to hide, you can pass property names you want to hide by using the `additionalFieldsToMask` setting like in the example below.

```js
useTreblle(app, {
  apiKey: "_YOUR_API_KEY_",
  projectId: "_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_",
  additionalFieldsToMask: ["secretField", "highlySensitiveField"],
});
```

### Logging errors

For easier debugging when sending the data to Treblle errors are visible by default, you can control it via the `showErrors` flag, you can disable the errors with `showErrors` set to `false`:

```js
useTreblle(app, {
  apiKey: "_YOUR_API_KEY_",
  projectId: "_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_",
  showErrors: false,
});
```
