Treblle makes it super easy to understand whatâ€™s going on with your APIs and the apps that use them. Just by adding Treblle to your API out of the box you get:
* Real-time API monitoring and logging
* Auto-generated API docs with OAS support
* API analytics
* Quality scoring
* One-click testing
* API managment on the go
* and more...

## Requirements
* nodejs

## Dependencies
* [`express`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [`node-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch)

## Installation
You can install Treblle for Node via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). Simply run the following command:
```bash
$ npm install treblle
```
Don't forget to load the required JS modules in your app.js like so:

```js
const express = require("express");
const { useTreblle } = require("treblle");
```

## Getting started
Next, create a FREE account on <https://treblle.com> to get an API key and Project ID. After you have those simply initialize Treblle in your **app.js** file like so:

```js
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

useTreblle(app, {
  apiKey: "_YOUR_API_KEY_",
  projectId: "_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_",
});
```
That's it. Your API requests and responses are now being sent to your Treblle project. Just by adding that line of code you get features like: auto-documentation, real-time request/response monitoring, error tracking and so much more.


### Running Treblle only in production
If you want to run Treblle only in production, you can rely on the environment variables, or use a similar approach via config.

```js
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  useTreblle(app, {
    apiKey: "_YOUR_API_KEY_",
    projectId: "_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_",
  });
}
```

### Need to hide additional fields?
If you want to expand the list of fields you want to hide, you can pass property names you want to hide by using the `additionalFieldsToMask` setting like in the example below.

```js
useTreblle(app, {
    apiKey: "_YOUR_API_KEY_",
    projectId: "_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_",
    additionalFieldsToMask: ["secretField", "highlySensitiveField"]
  });
```

### Logging errors
For easier debugging when sending the data to Treblle errors are visible by default, you can control it via the `showErrors` flag, you can disable the errors with `showErrors` set to `false`:

```js
useTreblle(app, {
    apiKey: "_YOUR_API_KEY_",
    projectId: "_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_",
    showErrors: false
  });
```
